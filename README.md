### A Chrome Extension and bookmarklet that lets you read webpages one word at a time.

Currently non-functional at a request from Spritz Technology, Inc., who kindly linked [their patent](https://www.google.com/patents/WO2014011884A1?cl=en&dq=WO+2014-011884&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oZ2PU8n9OsiLqAbesYKgAQ&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA) and spoke quite highly of ten more patents yet to come.

So don't uncomment the main functional call or listener, or this toy reader will become an attractive morsel for Spritz's cookpot, bless them.
